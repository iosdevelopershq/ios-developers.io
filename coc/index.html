      <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within
        the
        <a href="https://ios-developers.io" target="_blank"
          >iOS Developers HQ</a
        >
        community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are
        committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and
        expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code
        of conduct may be banned from the community.
      </p>
      <p>iOS Developers HQ strives to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Be helpful, friendly and patient</strong>: Many of our members
          are either junior developers or just starting their iOS development
          journey which makes our help channels among the most active. We are
          incredibly grateful for everyone's contribution to these channels.
          Please choose your responses in a manner that encourages participation
          and minimizes intimidation. Question and answer communities on the web
          are notorious for the toxicity that often comes with getting help. We
          pride ourselves with the fact that this is a differentiating factor
          for us. Please help us to keep it that way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that
          welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
          includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity,
          culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and
          economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
          identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
          religion, and mental and physical ability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other
          people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any
          decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should
          take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember
          that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating
          in someone else's primary language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time,
          but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We
          might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
          allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important
          to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
          threatened is not a productive one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: we are a
          community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
          Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
          Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements,
          both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that
          we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
          that we're different. The strength of our community comes from its
          diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
          have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
          someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't
          forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us
          anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning
          from mistakes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>iOS Developers HQ discourages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Crossposting</strong>: Cross-posting is considered as spam and
          discouraged. Please help to keep the channels clean and consistent
          with their intended purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condescending tone</strong>: Please try and be kind when
          asking questions or providing answers. Every member of this community
          had to learn what they now know at some point. Try to remember that
          when you are responding.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently

        <li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>

        <li>Stalking or following</li>
        <li>

          for harassment purposes
        </li>
        <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
        <li>
          Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual
          images or behaviour
        </li>
        <li>
          Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
          inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
        </li>
        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>
          Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their
          consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse
        </li>
        <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over
        privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and
          'cisphobia'
        </li>
        <li>
          Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go
          away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
        </li>
        <li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>
        <li>Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial</li>
        <li>
          Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive
          behavior or assumptions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Diversity Statement</h3>
      <p>
        We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a
        community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat
        everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant
        has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If
        someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen
        carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity
        in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity,
        language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race,
        religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical
        ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the
        protected characteristics above, including participants with
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Reporting Issues</h3>
      <p>
        If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior - or have any other
        concerns - please report it by contacting one of the
        <a href="/#team">admins</a>. All reports will be handled with
        discretion. In your report please include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your contact information.</li>
        <li>
          Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
          there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your
          account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
          If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive
          or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
        </li>
        <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally,
        review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a
        decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is
        part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling
        your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response
        team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We
        will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
        victims of abuse.
      </p>
